int main(OSI Layers)
{
    /* The OSI model describes seven layers that computer systems 
       use to communicate over a network*/
    
    
    Layer 7 - Application (It provides interface for the application 
                           user in order to transmit data);

    Layer 6 - Presentation (It receives data from the Application layer. 
                            It translates the data into a standardised 
                            format, as well handling any encryption);

    Layer 5 - Session (It is designed to start and stop communication between 
                       one endpoint and another. It uses control protocols, or 
                       tunneling protocols, in order to begin the communication
                       of data between one device and another);

    Layer 4 - Transport (Its first purpose is to choose the protocol over
                         which the data is to be transmitted. TCP or UDP.
                         With a protocol selected, the transport layer then
                         devides the transmition up into bite-sized pieces.)
                         {
                            TCP(Secure, Connection-oriented, Slow, Guaranteed transmition,
                                Used by critical applications, Flow control);
                            UDP(Unsecured, Connectionless, Fast, No guarantee,
                                Used by Real-time applications, No flow control);
                         }

    Layer 3 - Network (It is reponsible for locating the destination of the request.
                       At this stage we are working with logical addresses, such as, IPv4, IPv6...
                       Over TCP these are called segments, over UDP the are called datagrams);
    
    Layer 2 - Data Link (It receives the packet from layer 3 and adds the physical address (MAC).
                         Inside every network enabled computer is a Network Interface Card (NIC)
                         which comes with a unique MAC to identify it. MACs can be changed, but 
                         every MAC has a unique IP.);

    Layer 1 - Physical (Its job is to convert the binary data of the transmition signals
                        and transmit accross the network, as well receiving incoming 
                        signals and converting them to binary);


    Encapsulation (Every protocol has a header and a payload. The entire upper protocol
                   packet (header + payload) is the payload of the lower one, this __is_identifier
                   called encapsulation);
}

int 2nd_main(Networking)
{
    Packets (The primary goal of networking is to exchange information between
             networked computersn this information is carried by packets);
    Packet Structure (Header (ensures that the receiving host can correctly
                      interpret the payload) + Payload (the actual information));
    Routers (Acts like traffic manager in order for the packets run through the
             internet smoothly);
}

int 3rd_main (Wireshark)
{
    /*Wireshark is an open-source sniffer tool. A sniffer allows you to see
      the data transmitted over the network to and from your computer*/

    Colours meaning
    {
        Light purple - TCP;
        Light blue - UDP;
        Black - Packets with errors;
        Light green - HTTP traffic;
        Light yellow - Windows-specific traffic, including Server Message Blocks (SMB) and NetBIOS;
        Dark yellow - Routing;
        Dark gray - TCP SYN, FIN and ACK traffic;
